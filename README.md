# ðŸš˜ FastPlateOCR-Pro

An efficient and robust **Automatic License Plate OCR model** optimized for real-world conditions (blurry, low-res, noisy plates).  
This project is an improved version of **FastPlateOCR**, with the following upgrades:

âœ… Super-Resolution (SR) preprocessing for tiny/blurred plates  
âœ… Beam Search decoding for higher accuracy  
âœ… Mixed Precision training (AMP) for faster GPU usage  
âœ… EMA (Exponential Moving Average) stabilization  
âœ… Clean dataset pipeline (CSV + folder based)  
âœ… Runs fully on GPU (tested on RTX 3050 4GB)  
âœ… Supports both **images and video**
